# 🧠 Agent as Tool – OpenAI Function Calling Example

This repository demonstrates how to use an **OpenAI Function Tool Agent** architecture with custom behavior and error handling using the OpenAI Agent SDK.

## 🚀 Features

- **Agent as Tool:** Demonstrates how to wrap one agent to be used as a callable tool by another agent.
- **Custom Output Extraction:** Clean formatting and control over agent responses.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles validation and execution errors in tools.
- **Modular Design:** Separate files for agent logic, models, and custom formatting.

## 🛠️ Files Explained

- **agent_as_tool.py:** Entry point. Demonstrates agent-to-agent interaction.

- **customizing_tool_agents.py:** To customize agent.as_tool we use agent and runner inside a function tool decorator and set max_turns in the Runner.

- **custom_output_extraction.py:** You can do this by supplying the custom_output_extractor argument to the as_tool method

- **model.py:** Defines Pydantic models for function tools.

- **pyproject.toml:** Project dependencies and configurations.

- **uv.lock:** Lock file generated by uv.
